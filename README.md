This repository contains a code for the Implementation pf  an image classification pipeline using CNN to classify the natural scenes images into different classes. 
**Convolutional Neural Network ** Within Deep Learning, a Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is a type of artificial neural network, which is widely used for image/object recognition and classification. Deep Learning thus recognizes objects in an image by using a CNN. CNNs are playing a major role in diverse tasks/functions like image processing problems, computer vision tasks like localization and segmentation, video analysis, to recognize obstacles in self-driving cars, as well as speech recognition in natural language processing. As CNNs are playing a significant role in these fast-growing and emerging areas, they are very popular in Deep Learning.
The repository contains the file of code in which I have used the squential algorithm of CNN. Following are the libaraies used in the code:
Numpy
tensorflow
Sklearn metrices
Matplotlib
For the data, I have used the kaggle data of natural scenes. In google colab, using kaggle API, downloaded the data.
